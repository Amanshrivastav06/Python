# You need to write a program which does the following
'''
1. Accepts 2 integers as input in 1st line as the variables A, B
2. Accepts 3 integers as input in 2nd line as the variables C, D, E
3. Accepts 4 integers as input in 3rd line as the variables f, g , h , i
Prints out 9 integers as output in a single line to the console
'''
A , B = map(int , input("enter the integers : ").split())
C, D , E = map(int, input("enter the integers: ").split())
F, G , H, I = map(int, input("enter the integers: ").split())
print(A, B , C, D , E ,F , G ,H ,I)
